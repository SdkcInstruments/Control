# Control
Control is a 1:4 Demultiplexer consisting of four Offset/Attenuverters.

In addition to the usual CV inputs, you can use an expression pedal, adding an important element of foot control to your Eurorack performance.

When there is no input to the CV inputs of each channel, the Master Knob and Expedal In inputs are internally connected to all channels. When a cable is connected to the CV input of Ch2 or later, the internal connection is cut at that point and continues to operate similarly thereafter.

Example: If external CV is input to Ch3, the Master Knob and EXPin CV are connected to Ch1 and Ch2, and the CV input to Ch3 is connected to Ch3 and Ch4.

# Control's Controls
### Master Knob
Controls 0V-8V CV. This input is internally connected to all knobs in the default state.

### EXP in
You can connect an expression pedal commonly used with guitars. It outputs 0V-8V.   
Control supports TRS-connected control pedals, commonly used, with the following polarities switchable via the switch on the back.

CW-Sleeve / Wiper-Tip / CCW-Ring

### Attenuverter
Amplifies the input signal by *-1 to *1.

### Offset
Adds an offset voltage of -8V to 8V.

Both the Offset and Attenuverter knobs have a center click, but because analog circuits are used, they do not necessarily zero at the center.
